Action is the repository that contains reusable Tinkerbell Actions maintained by
the Tinkerbell community.

This is an ongoing and work in progress collaboration with
[ArtifactHub](https://artifacthub.io) a project sponsored by the CNCF.

To know more about the direction of the project have a look at proposal number
[0021](https://github.com/tinkerbell/proposals/blob/master/proposals/0021/README.md)

...More will come I promise but if you are curious you can [join our contributors
meeting, or our Slack channel](https://tinkerbell.org/community/).
